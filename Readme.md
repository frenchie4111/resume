# Resume: MD to PDF

Yet another MD to PDF project. Decided to start a new one because none of the ones I could find
worked the way I wanted.

This project uses pandoc and headless chrome to convert markdown into pdfs. It is designed
to support both an html and pdf version of your resume.

It is also intended to support per-company cover letters and resume versions.
