Neuralink,

I am a lifelong engineer who loves working on hard problems with smart people.
I've spent a majority of my career working on ML enabled hardware products, and 
I am passionate about how AI will allow machines to extend the capabilities of
humanity.

<i>probably need some talk about my qualifications here</i>

I think what you are building at Neuralink is an imperative technological milestone,
and I would love to be a part of what you are doing.

Mike Lyons
